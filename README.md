# Analysing Cape Town Airbnb listing data

## Project Motivation

As a Data Scientist, I'm always interested in the data underlying everything, so you can imagine my delight when I discovered that Airbnb data are just a mouse click away. [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) makes Airbnb listing information available for us Data Scientists to play with.
I made use of the November 2018 Cape Town, South Africa listings and was interested in answering the following questions:

* How important is location in determining the price of the accommodation
* What types of accommodation are available
* What are the main drivers of price
* Do hosts increase their prices significantly between low season and high season?


## Installation
### Dependencies

For my analysis I made use of the following dependencies:
* Python 3.6.7
* pandas 0.22.0
* plotly 3.6.1
* scikit-learn 0.19.1
* matplotlib 2.2.3 
* seaborn 0.9.0


### User installation
Clone the github repository and install all the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:Rmostert/Airbnb-CT-analysis.git
```
